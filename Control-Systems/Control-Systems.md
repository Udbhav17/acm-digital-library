## Control Systems
A control system is defined as a system of devices that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems to achieve a desired result.
It achieves this through control loops, which are a process designed to maintain a process variable at a desired set point.
The three basic parts of a control system are:  
  * The error detector
  * The controller 
  * The output element
